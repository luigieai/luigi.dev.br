AWS consultant, member of the migration team, responsible for architecting and migrating infrastructure solutions to the Cloud.

I worked with several AWS services, including EC2, CloudFront, Route53, EKS, ECR, RDS, and others. I am also implemented Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible as tools for provisioning and managing servers. Additionally, I have worked with GitLabCI to create and manage deployment pipelines, and with New Relic APM and Dynatrace for monitoring. 

Also, I have experience working with ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
