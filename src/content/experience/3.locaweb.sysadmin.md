As a Systems Administrator, I was responsible for the administration and maintenance of Linux (CentOO, Debian, Ubuntu) and Windows Server (2008, 2012, and 2016) servers. My key responsibilities included:

- Administration of web servers (Apache and Nginx) and web control panels (Cpanel, Plesk) including updating packages, analyzing logs for solving incidents, and developing basic scripts for task automation.

- Database server administration of SQLServer, MySQL, and PostgreSQL including installation, configuration, and maintenance.

- Backup management and execution using Bacula, ensuring data safety and recovery.

- Management of changes, incidents, and problems including changes, migrations, and incident resolution through the ServiceNow platform.

- Administration of virtualized environments using XenServer and VMware.

- Monitoring of servers using Check MK, Zabbix, Grafana, Cockpit to identify and address issues before they impact the end-users.

- Creation and update of technical documentation to ensure operational efficiency and knowledge transfer.

During that time, I showed strong technical skills in network protocols and services, familiarization with ITIL best practices, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver results.
