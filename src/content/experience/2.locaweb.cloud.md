As a Cloud Support Analyst, I have technical skills in Firewall, SSL, network protocols and services, Linux, VPS, and Dedicated servers. I have extensive experience in DNS configuration (NS, SPF, MX, CNAME, TXT, SOA, A, AAAA, SRV), network troubleshooting (nslookup, tracert and traceroute, telnet, ping, ipconfig, MTR, whois, netcat, iptables), troubleshooting resolution, and CMS installation and configuration (including Wordpress, Laravel, among others).

I also supported MySQL and SQL Server databases, as well as Linux (CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu) and Windows (Server 2003, 2008, and 2012) operating systems, also working with Apache and Varnish. For all of these always doing performance and incidents troubleshooting and creating resolutions for the final product client.

In addition to my technical skills, I am familiar with ITIL practices and have experience in creating internal and end user documentation. I am also capable of evaluating hacked websites and analyzing logs to identify potential attacks on the environment.
